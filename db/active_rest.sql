('Active Rest', 'Note the word active! Do not sit on the couch and binge watch Breaking Bad all day. Today is a recovery day but your muscles will need the movement to work out the lactic acid that is built up. You can do anything you choose! Go hiking or walk around a nearby shopping center or clean the house.')
